## Motivation

- As **a contributor to the GO-CART Framework**, 
- I'd like **a trivial, simple behavior**
- as **to demonstrate the simplest possible application of the framework**

## Description

Calculating quadratic equations (a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0) is something we have all learned in high school and offers a nice "hello-world"-level use-case.
We understand that using the framework to do this is *massive* overkill, but it serves just as an example.
We'll do this by implementing a simple behavior that consists of 3 steps:

- Initialize the Calculation
- Calculate the Discriminator
- Calculate the Roots
