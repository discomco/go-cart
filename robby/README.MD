## Definition
Robby is a complete *go-cart application* and is part of the training material for the Purposeful Method,
It illustrates how the various types of application are manufactured and deployed.

## Motivation
- As the **Maintainer** of the go-cart SDK
- I require a **sample application**
- That I **can field-test the SDK in a non-critical environment**
- And **provide the community with a working sample**

## General Description
*Robby* is a turn-based game, that features a playing field on which robots can move around and do battle.

## Discovery Artifacts

## Getting Started.
The Purposeful Method starts with a *Discovery Phase* which results in:
- Context *Map* (aka 'The Big Picture')
- A number of *Contexts* with for each context:
  - The Behavioral Model (from Event Storming)
  - The Structural Model (from DDD)
A *Context*'s boundaries are defined by its behavior, in other words,
  - a Context supports a business process end-to-end and 
  - its data model should support just enough structures, not more,not less than is required to support this process autonomously.

### What we got from discovery.
So far, we have a rough understanding of what the system should look like here: [Big Picture Diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPa2FZfk=/)
And we have one Context that is considered ready for implementation: [Execute Game](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPa2FWuY=/)
